<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Purpose
The main purpose of this application was to become familiar with creating REST API in Spring Boot technology. 
The main idea is to create an app that allows restaurant owners to add their places along with their dishes. 
And then regular users will be able to view the reviews and ratings, and rate for themselves. 
At the current stage, the application allows CRUD operations on dishes and restaurants.

### Technology
It is Spring Boot RESR API. Maven is used to download and manage dependencies. Data are saved with in-memory H2 database.
Interactive documentation is generated by Swagger. Thanks to Lombok, the repetitive code has been replaced by appropriate annotations.
But project is still in development stage.


### Built With
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Quick start Spring Framework web applications
* [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) - The Java SQL database
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - Reduce repeatable code
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - Generate REST API documentation


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, for development and testing purposes.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
To test out this application, you need Maven to build the dependencies.

2. First, install the dependencies
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Run the production build with live reload
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
 ## Usage
 Interactive API documentation is built with Swagger, available at
 ```sh
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   ```
 
 ## TODO
 * Add pagination to GET endpoints.
 * Implement different dto for PUT, POST and GET
 * Implement authentication and authorization
